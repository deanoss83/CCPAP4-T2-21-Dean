                    <h2> This is the part where I introduce myself.</h2>
                    <p> Now some would do this part further up the page. But not me. Not when there's videos and photos
                        to look
                        at. Which, given that you're here, is what I assume you want to see.</p>

                    <p>I'm Dean Flanagan, and the video, photos and word you will be looking at today were all created
                        by me. Well maybe not the words, I think they've been around for a while, but this combination
                        of words is all my work.</p>
                    <p>If you would like me to make some video, photos or words for you, please send me a message via
                        the link below. If this nonsense of a paragraph hasn't convinced you, please have a look at the
                        About Me section where I'm far more serious, or have a look arond at those afroementioned videos
                        and photos.</p>
